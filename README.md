commitlint lint commit messages to satisfy [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

commitlint helps your team adhere to a commit convention. By supporting pub-installed configurations it makes sharing of commit conventions easy.


## Getting started

### Install

Add `commitlint_cli` to your `dev_dependencies` in pubspec.yaml

```bash
# Install commitlint_cli
dart pub add --dev commitlint_cli
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Configure commitlint to use conventional config
echo "include: package:commitlint_cli/commitlint.yaml" > commitlint.yaml
```

### Test

```bash
# Lint from stdin
echo 'foo: bar' | dart run commitlint_cli
⧗  input: type: add docs
✖  type must be one of [build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test] type-enum

✖  found 1 errors, 0 warnings
```

```bash
# Lint last commit from history
commitlint --from=HEAD~1
```
## Setup git hook

With [husky](https://pub.dev/packages/husky) (a tool for managing git hooks), commitlint cli can be used as commmit-msg git hook

and [husky](https://pub.dev/packages/husky)
### Set `commit-msg` hook:

```sh
dart pub add --dev husky
dart run husky install
dart run husky set .husky/commit-msg 'dart run commitlint_cli --edit "$1"'
```

### Make a commit:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Keep calm and commit"
# `dart run commitlint_cli --edit "$1"` will run
```

> To get the most out of `commitlint` you'll want to automate it in your project lifecycle. See our [Setup guide](https://hyiso.github.io/commitlint/#/guides-setup) for next steps.
